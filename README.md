### I want to make a procedural model of something. Unsure what yet, as I do not yet know the scope of what is possible in this course, but if possible an environment. 
#### I hope to utilize procedural modeling for trees, buildings, and streets. I guess the feature will be executed by importing models, then implementing the program to procedurally place them. 
##### I will need to learn how to procedurally place models into a scene, along with potentially learning how to procedurally model.
###### Ideal outcome is an environment that utilizes procedural modeling. The minimum viable outcome is that I can make some sort of art utilizing procedual modeling.
###### My weekly goals are the first week of november to learn how to use procedural art. Second week is to try to use proceduralism to make models. Third week is to make more models. Final week is putting all the models into a scene and screen record.
