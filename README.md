## Description
    My project is meant to create 10 random objects from the list of cube, cylinder, torus, cone, or sphere, rotate it randomly, apply a random color, and place it in the scene randomly. I do not have many files in my repository. I have the proposal.md file, with my revised final project proposal. I have the README.md file, that has the information regarding my title, demo video, my GitHub repository, and this description. I decided to challenge myself this project, and implement my newly found skills from this class and apply it to a program I have had quite a bit of practice in.

    I had considered maybe doing a whole scene of procedurally generated objects, placed neatly and make a sort of townsquare or something of the sort. However, it turned out to be way past the scope of what was possible with what I had learned, so I went with this. I hit some unique obstacles along the way, such as a height issue when generating certain objects, but was able to perservere. It was very rewarding to find solutions to these problems. I would like to impove this code by doing what I had initially intended on doing, and make a townsquare area completely from code, along with applying materials strategically.
